# Math Quiz Project

A simple Python math quiz that generates random arithmetic questions and quizzes the user.

## How It Works

- Generates math expressions with random operators (+, -, *) and operands.
- Asks the user to solve 5 math questions.
- Tracks and reports the number of correct answers and total time taken.

## What I Learned and Used

- Generating random numbers and operators with `random` module.
- Evaluating expressions dynamically with `eval()`.
- Measuring elapsed time using `time` module.
- Handling user input and validation in a loop.
- Basic program flow with functions, loops, and conditionals.

## Skills Used

Python, Random Number Generation, Expression Evaluation, User Input, Timing, CLI Design
